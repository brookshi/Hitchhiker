At first, we need create a Project for your API.

Go to Project module, click `create project` button, then Hitchhiker will add a new Project item, let's named it `SampleAPI`:

A project is created, now we can invite team to join `SampleAPI` to collaborate development:

1. Click `Invite Members` button.

2. Enter emails split with `;`.

3. Click OK button.

Now everyone you invited will receive a mail, they need click the button `Accept` in the mail to accept your invitation to join this project. Then you can see your team are in `SampleAPI` member list.

Only project's owner can remove member from this project. Owner also can disband project then every member will lose this Project and collections of it.

Notice there is a `localhost` column that every member can edit it. It's used for debug your localhost API, `localhost` for server is server itself, you have to make server known where your computer are, so change `localhost` to your IP and when send a request with host `localhost`, server will change host to your IP get from this mapping.
